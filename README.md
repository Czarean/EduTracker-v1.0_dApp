# `EduTracker v0.1` School Management dApp  
Development project for graduation and certification of ICP HUB Mexico June-July 2024!  
  
## Description of the EduTracker v0.1 dApp:  
`EduTracker` is a comprehensive application designed in the `Motoko` programming language developed by `DFinity` for the `Internet Computer ICP Blockchain`. EduTracker Pro is designed to manage Schools student and teacher information, monitor student academic progress, and automate administrative processes, optimizing educators' time and effort.  

`Note: This might not be the best, more efficient or optimal code to accomplish this, but this certainly does the job, I did what I could with the lil knowledge I have gathered this past few weeks, So if you have any advise or feedback please let me know, I would appreciate it a lot, Thanks.`

  
## Methods and Functions Used in the Current Motoko Code:  
  
**Add Students**    
- Creation of HashMap: `Students.Hashmap`  
- `Students.put` HashMap: Adds students to the HashMap  
  
**Delete Students**    
- `Students.delete(delete)`  
- `Switch/Case` Used to check if the teacher's name input exists or not! If it doesn't exist, it returns a message; if it does, it deletes it.  

**Add Teachers**    
- `if/else:` Conditions for error/result deployment  
- `result:` error deployment when not all fields are filled  
- Creation of HashMap: `Professors.Hashmap`  
- `Professors.put` HashMap  
  
**Delete Teachers**    
- `Professors.delete(delete)`  
- Uses `Switch/Case` to check if the teacher's name input exists or not! If it doesn't exist, it returns a message; if it does, it deletes it.  
  
**Other Functions and Methods Used:**    
- `Types:` Students, Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Tracker, Subjects, Scores  
- `Nested Types:` Types containing elements within other Types with other elements.  
- `Concatenation` in the response message.  
- `await` Allows us to wait for an asynchronous message to respond before continuing the code.  
- `and & not` used to ensure no field is left blank when adding a new Teacher to the database.  
- `Module:` Moves all Types to a new module folder and adds Public to the variables; in the main.mo, Types are imported and modified as MyTypes.students.
